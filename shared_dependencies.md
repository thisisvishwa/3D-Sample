Shared Dependencies:

1. **HTML Elements (DOM IDs)**
   - `#canvas` - The ID for the HTML canvas element where the 3D scene will be rendered.
   - `#loader` - The ID for the loading screen element before the 3D content is fully loaded.

2. **CSS Classes**
   - `.hidden` - A class to toggle visibility of elements, such as the loader.
   - `.interactive` - A class for elements that have interactive features.

3. **JavaScript Variables**
   - `scene` - The Three.js scene object.
   - `camera` - The Three.js camera object.
   - `renderer` - The Three.js WebGL renderer.
   - `model` - The variable holding the 3D model imported from `example_model.glb`.
   - `animations` - An array or object containing the animation clips for the model.
   - `controls` - The object managing interactive controls (e.g., orbit controls).

4. **JavaScript Functions**
   - `init()` - Function to initialize the scene, camera, renderer, and load models.
   - `animate()` - Function to create the animation loop.
   - `onWindowResize()` - Function to handle window resize events.
   - `loadModel()` - Function to load the 3D model.
   - `setupAnimations()` - Function to set up animations for the model.
   - `setupInteraction()` - Function to set up interactive features.

5. **Three.js Library**
   - `THREE` - The global namespace for the Three.js library, used across all JS files that deal with 3D content.

6. **Textures and Models**
   - `example_model.glb` - The 3D model file used in `js/interaction.js` and `js/three.js`.
   - `texture_diffuse.jpg` - The diffuse map used in materials within `js/three.js`.
   - `texture_normal.jpg` - The normal map used in materials within `js/three.js`.
   - `texture_specular.jpg` - The specular map used in materials within `js/three.js`.

7. **Shaders**
   - `vertexShader` - The variable holding the GLSL code for the vertex shader in `shaders/vertexShader.glsl`.
   - `fragmentShader` - The variable holding the GLSL code for the fragment shader in `shaders/fragmentShader.glsl`.

8. **Message Names**
   - `modelLoaded` - A custom event or message that might be dispatched once the model has finished loading.
   - `animationStarted` - A custom event or message that might be dispatched when an animation starts.
   - `interactionEvent` - A custom event or message for when an interaction occurs.

9. **Data Schemas**
   - `ModelData` - A schema for the structure of the 3D model data, including mesh, materials, and animations.
   - `AnimationData` - A schema for the animation clips and their properties.
   - `InteractionData` - A schema for defining interactive elements and their responses to user input.

These shared dependencies would be used across the various files to ensure that the 3D website functions correctly and that all components are synchronized in terms of design, functionality, and data management.
