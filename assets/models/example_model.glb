The file `assets/models/example_model.glb` is a binary file that contains a 3D model in the GLB format, which is the binary version of the GLTF format. This file is not something that can be generated through code as it represents a 3D asset created in a 3D modeling software like Blender, Maya, or 3ds Max.

To use this file, you would typically export a 3D model from a 3D modeling software in the GLB format and then place it in the `assets/models/` directory of your project. The actual content of a GLB file is binary data representing the geometry, materials, textures, and animations of a 3D model.

Since I cannot generate binary 3D model data as text, I cannot provide you with the content for `example_model.glb`. You would need to create or obtain a 3D model and save it as `example_model.glb` in the `assets/models/` directory to be used in your 3D website project.
